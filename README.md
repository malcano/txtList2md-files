# txtList2md-files

This is a very simple shell script for creating the bunch of the txt fileswith txt list and template.md.

## How to use

### 1. Create txt files

Just like **main.txt**(Do not write .md)

### 2. Create template.md

#### (You can change the file name as you want. But the file name should be like \*.md in this case. The contents of the templates doesn't matter.)

### 3. Execute auto.sh in Terminal

```sh
sh auto.sh [main.txt] [template.md]
```
